		<p> This experience happened on 19th of december year 2024. A little later after paskuhan, my bestfriend and I decided to have dinner at Mcdonald's since our curfew ends at 8 PM and the event ended at 7 PM. As we were walking towards the tricycle terminal, I was already feeling emotional because of something personal I had to deal with. My best friend and I had been talking about it while we were riding the tricycle and I could already feel a lump forming in my throat as I held my tears back. When we finally arrived at Mcdonald's, the waiter who served our food radiated a warm energy. Yet, I still felt a little blue. Just then, as we were eating, I suddenly burst into tears, my chest feeling heavy. My tears were still in my control, holding it back and wiping it every now and then because it felt embarrassing to be crying in public. Just when the tissues were running out, the same waiter came up to our table and gave me extra tissues intentionally. He told me 'Excuse me ate, extra tissues for your tears po. Kaya niyo yan.' My heart melted instantly. How can someone be so nice? And because I am the type of person to get more emotional whenever I receive any sense of comfort, I burst into tears again while I said thank you. Suddenly, my snot came out of my nose. I apologized and laughed it off. He didn't laugh at me, though. Now that I think about it, it's not really funny. Please disregard the title, this story is actually embarrassing. </p>
